# Fetch_VisiLibity
This code uses the VisiLibity1 algorithm to calculate the fetch (distance over which can blow and generate waves) and associated wave energy proportionality for each point along a shoreline. The wind field is assumed to be isotropic.

 % Next, youâ€™ll need to mex the cpp files in matlab.
% mex in matlab
mex -setup
mex -v in_environment.cpp visilibity.o
mex -v visibility_polygon.cpp visilibity.o

% You are now ready to run Fetch_VisiLibity! See the example file for more info.
